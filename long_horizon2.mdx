## <kbd>class</kbd> `LongHorizon2`
This Long-Horizon datasets wrapper class, provides with utility to download and wrangle the following datasets: ETT, ECL, Exchange, Traffic, ILI and Weather. 


- Each set is normalized with the train data mean and standard deviation. 
- Datasets are partitioned into train, validation and test splits. 
- For all datasets: 70%, 10%, and 20% of observations are train, validation, test,  except ETT that uses 20% validation.
