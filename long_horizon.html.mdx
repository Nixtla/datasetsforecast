from a region of a province of China including oil temperature
and variants of load (such as high useful load and high useless load)
from July 2016 to July 2018 at a fifteen minute frequency.

ECL(freq='15T', name='ECL', n_ts=321, test_size=5260, val_size=2632, horizons=(96, 192, 336, 720))
```

The Electricity dataset reports the fifteen minute electricity
consumption (KWh) of 321 customers from 2012 to 2014.
For comparability, we aggregate it hourly.

eight countries relative to the US dollar. The countries include
Australia, UK, Canada, Switzerland, China, Japan, New Zealand and
Singapore from 1990 to 2016.

```

This dataset reports weekly recorded influenza-like illness (ILI)
patients from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the
United States from 2002 to 2021. It is measured as a ratio of ILI
patients versus the total patients in the week.

### `LongHorizon`

```python
LongHorizon(source_url='https://nhits-experiments.s3.amazonaws.com/datasets.zip')
```

This Long-Horizon datasets wrapper class, provides
with utility to download and wrangle the following datasets:
ETT, ECL, Exchange, Traffic, ILI and Weather.

- Each set is normalized with the train data mean and standard deviation.
- Datasets are partitioned into train, validation and test splits.
- For all datasets: 70%, 10%, and 20% of observations are train, validation, test,
  except ETT that uses 20% validation.
